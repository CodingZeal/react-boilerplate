# react-boilerplate

Zeal's boilerplate setup for React/Redux projects.

This boilerplate contains our standard React/Redux setup for larger single-page front-end applications.

We expect that the front-end application will be embedded into a project along with the back-end application, likely in Rails.  The boilerplate is structured based on that assumption.

The boilerplate includes all of the tools that we're currently using in our React projects; you may not need all of it, so feel free to remove the parts that you don't need.

We assume some familiarity with the React/Redux ecosystem, including Babel and Webpack.
